# Image_Classifier_Web_App
A website wherin a transfer learning model is deployed and classifies uploaded images and gives the option to change the hyperparameters of the model while retraining
 
## The model used was vgg19
location:hackathon\imagesrec\static\imagesrec\vgg_model2

## Transfer_Learning.ipynb
The jupyter notebook used for transfer learning on Google Colab to train the model 

## Dataset :
location:data(the link for this dataset is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification

## Functionalities :
1.Bulk Training Model and Inference

2.Retraining model using the given images

3.Training the model by changing parameters

4.Integration django with pytorch
